              <p>This privacy policy applies to information collected online from users of this website. In this
                policy, you
                can learn what kind of information we collect, when and how we might use that information, how we
                protect
                the information, and the choices you have with respect to your personal information.</p>
              <h3>What personal information is collected through this website and how is it used?</h3>
              <p>We collect information about our users in three ways: directly from the user, from our Web server logs
                and
                through cookies. We use the information primarily to provide you with a personalized Internet
                experience
                that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. We
                don't
                share any of the information you provide with others, unless we say so in this Privacy Policy, or when
                we
                believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>User-supplied information</strong>: If you fill out the &ldquo;contact&rdquo; form on this
                website, we will
                ask you to provide some personal information (such as e-mail address, name, phone number and state). We
                only
                require that you provide an e-mail address on the contact form. Further, if chat is available through
                this
                site, you may be asked to provide information if you participate in an online chat. Please do not
                submit
                any confidential, proprietary or sensitive personally identifiable information (e.g. Social Security
                Number;
                date of birth; drivers license number; or credit card, bank account or other financial information)
                (collectively,
                "Sensitive Information"). If you submit any Sensitive Information, you do so at your own risk and we
                will
                not be liable to you or responsible for consequences of your submission.</p>
              <p>Information that you provide to us through the contact form or an online chat will be used so that we
                may respond
                to your inquiry. We may also use information you provide to us to communicate with you in the future.
                If
                you do not wish to receive such communications, you may opt out (unsubscribe) as described below.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Web server logs</strong>: When you visit our website, we may track information about your visit
                and store
                that information in web server logs, which are records of the activities on our sites. The servers
                automatically
                capture and save the information electronically. Examples of the information we may collect include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>your unique Internet protocol address; </li>
                <li>the name of your unique Internet service provider; </li>
                <li>the town/city, county/state and country from which you access our website; </li>

                <li>the date and time of your visit; </li>
                <li>the web page from which you arrived to our site; </li>
                <li>the pages you viewed on the site; and </li>
                <li>certain searches/queries that you conducted via our website(s). </li>
              </ul>
              <p>The information we collect in web server logs helps us administer the site, analyze its usage, protect
                the
                website and its content from inappropriate use and improve the user's experience.</p>
